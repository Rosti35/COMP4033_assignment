Scenario:
    Assess patients when they come in to establish whether patient needs to be sent to hospital for emergency attention

    Inputs:
        - Temperature
        - Headache
        - Patient Age
        All linguistic variables

    Output:
        - Urgency (degree of severity of condition)

Inputs:
    - Temperature (rated in degrees Celsius)
        AVERAGE TEMPERATURE
        https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001982.htm#:~:text=The%20average%20normal%20body%20temperature,
        by%20an%20infection%20or%20illness.
        36.1 to 37.2 is normal
        - high is 37.8+ (fever, concerning) https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/infections-and-poisoning/fever-in-adults/
        - low is 35 - (concerning, hypothermia)

        * Younger people have higher body temps, older people have lower body temps since the ability to regulate our
        body temperature lessens as we age

    - Severity of headache (rated subjectively 0 - 10)
    - Age (scale of 0 to 130)

* Use set of rules to produce the output i.e. how urgent medical treatment is for the patient

Output:
    - quantified in range of 0 to 100
        - 0 : condition not at all urgent (no hospital)
        - 100 : condition extremely urgent (hospital asap)

** REMEMBER Not all variables are the same. Temperature has a normal range, above and below range can indicate issues.
   Higher the rating for headache, the worse the condition.
